# Blackbook
Blackbook is a personal reference repository where I organize and store all
kinds of technical documentation related to my hardware and software setups.
It’s my go-to resource for:
- Installing and configuring Windows PCs, Ubuntu workstations, and Raspberry
  Pi devices.
- Maintaining an up-to-date inventory of hardware components (motherboards,
  GPUs, PSUs, etc.).
- Documenting my home network topology, including schemas and configurations.
- Keeping step-by-step installation guides and troubleshooting instructions.

This repository is designed as a single source of truth for my personal tech
environment, making it easy to replicate setups, troubleshoot issues, or
upgrade systems efficiently.
